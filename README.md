In short, the goal is to move the business from **gut-based guesses to insight-driven strategies**, turning everyday data into a powerful competitive advantage.

<br>

## Business Challenge
Between 2021 and 2024, the company experienced robust sales volumes driven by strong demand across regions and customer segments. Yet, the bottom line told a different story, **profit margins were stuck at a lean 4**%. Despite crossing half a billion dollars in sales, the company was leaving serious money on the table.

**The Real Problem**:

Sales growth was not translating into sustainable profitability. Several pain points were evident:

-	**High-revenue months** didn‚Äôt always align with **high-profit periods**.

-	**Best-selling product lines** had **moderate-to-low margins**, indicating cost inefficiencies.

-	**Over-reliance on one major customer** created revenue concentration risks.

-	**Geographic underperformance** in key states was dragging down overall margins.

-	**Customer segments with low sales volume were surprisingly more efficient** than their high-volume counterparts.
  
**My Mission**:
As a data analyst, I set out to diagnose these contradictions, uncover the root causes, and build a clear roadmap from ‚Äú**data chao**s‚Äù to ‚Äú**data clarity**.‚Äù
